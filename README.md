Hello! This is the project for our CSC 308 & 309 classes with Chris Zielke for Software Engineering I & II.

This project is planned to encompass a roommate housing and agreement app with the following features:

- A

- C
- D
- E

# Installation

Clone the repo, ensure node is installed, and run the following:

```bash
npm install prettier
npm install lint
pre-commit install
npm i -g concurrently
```

## How to Run

`npm` has the ability to run the frontend and backend indvidually via the following commands

```
npm run backend
npm run frontend
```

However, we can run backend AND frontend via

```
npm run dev
```

### Formatting With ESLint and Prettier

upon every commit we run `prettier` and `eslint` via a _github automated workflow_

For this to work, make sure you have run

```bash
pre-commit install
```

as well as installed eslint and prettier

We have the following formatting syntax applied via prettier in addition to defaults: - `"tabWidth": 4,` - `"useTabs": true`
